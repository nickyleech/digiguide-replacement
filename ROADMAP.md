# digiguide.tv - Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status

The TV guide application has reached **advanced prototype stage** with comprehensive frontend features and professional-grade UI/UX. The project is **90% complete on frontend** with all major user-facing features implemented and polished. Key achievements include:

- **✅ Complete User System**: Full authentication, preferences, watchlists, and profile management
- **✅ Advanced Search & Discovery**: Multi-algorithm fuzzy search with typo tolerance, saved searches, and comprehensive filtering
- **✅ Programme Reminders**: Complete notification system with browser push notifications and preference management
- **✅ Professional Admin Interface**: Full administrative dashboard with user management, channel configuration, and analytics
- **✅ Premium UI/UX**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS, professional branding, and accessibility features
- **✅ Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript with comprehensive type safety

**Current State**: The application is production-ready on the frontend but requires backend infrastructure (database, API, payment processing) to launch. The critical path is now **backend integration and production deployment**.
